# QuoraClassifier
http://www.quora.com/challenges

This code solves the problem for quora's answer classifier challenge using a single layer neural net.

Each attribute will treat the input examples as binary, except we do not necessarily use 0s and 1s to represent input values.
Values of input were chosen based off results from varying them on validation set. Weights of the neural net were found through 
the backpropagation algorithm applied with the sigmoid function.

The score was 83.2 when I submitted the file.
